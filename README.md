# NoKe - Visual Studio Code Extension

This is an extension for the NoKe programming language (see [py-compiler](https://github.com/NoKe-Language/py-compiler)).

## Features
* Syntax highlighting for ``.idk`` files
* Icon theme (based on [seti-ui](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui), the default vscode theme. Every icon but noke ones belongs to seti-ui. If you know how to make an icon theme without having to redefine every single icon, please tell us.)

## Future feature
Those feature will (maybe) be implemented later.
* Linter for NoKe
* IntelliSense

## How to install
Download or clone the repository and put it inside ``~/.vscode/extensions``, then restart vscode.
Then, go to ``File``>``Preferences``>``File Icon Theme`` and select ``NoKe Icons``.
